 - Distance :
   - Nio(ni-o) 1nio or 1n = 5miles
   - Dio(di-o) 1dio or 1d = 1/2n  2d = 1n
   - Rio(ri-o) 1rio or 1r = 1/2d  2r = 1d , 4r = 1n
 - Weight :
   - Ker(k-er) 1ker or 1k = 10kilograms
   - Ber(b-er) 1ber or 1b = 1/2 k   2b = 1k
   - Ter(T-er) 1ter or 1t = 1/2 b   2t = 1b , 4t = 1k
 - Time :
   - Yem(ye-m) 1yem or 1y = 2h
   - Lem(le-m) 1lem or 1l = 1h   2l = 1y
   - Qem(qe-m) 1qem or 1q = 30min  2q = 1l , 4q = 1y
 - Temperature :

+ **Materials/Items**
 - Mithril :
     1k of mithril ore has a power output of 1GW. Mithril can also be used in a bomb. Mithril will blow up if the ore's power absorbtion limit is exceeded. The maximum power absorbtion limit of mithril is 1GW. It is recomended to only 
   use 80% of the mithril's power so it only has a 25% chance of blowing up. If you use 100% of the mithril's power it has a 50% chance of blowing up. If mithril blows-up it has a blast radius of 10n. It takes mithril 1y to fully regain its power from any percentage of power it has left.
 - Orthrim :
       Orthrim can neglect 99% of all physcal attacks from any weapon the only weapon that can distroy orthrim is an energy weapon based on mithril. Orthrim is commonly used for protection and as holding cells. Orthrim will melt at 50bp.
 - Anti :
       Anti can neglect all gravity and it can also invoke gravity on anything it can be disabled by distroying the core located in the center of the gem.The ore has the texture of mud and it is clear emitating a dim red glow. Anti will 
   melt at  20p
 - Nth :
       Nth can provide the user with overwhelming strength. Nth can't be frozen or melted it can only be distroyed by a mithril based energy weapon. Nth will also deplete the players energy. You can counter this by constantly pumping 
   the body with energy to replenish the supply that has been used up by the nth gem.
 - Aluminium Oxide C11 :
       This ore is used to create the strongest type of glass that can only be distroyed by a mithril based energy weapon. This ore has a clear color and very hard it will melt at 1bp.
 - Copper B4 :
       Copper B4 is used to conduct heat and electricity. Copper B4 will melt at 600p.

+ **Weapons/Usable items for the player**
  - The Energy Sword (_Tizona_) :
      - The sword has two mithril absorbers
      - The sword contains 1d per absorber
      - The sword's hilt is made out of Orthrim and anti
      - The chambers with mithril are lined with Rethrim
      - The sword has 4 modes for the energy blade :
           Mode 1 Safe mode : When 80% of the first mithril absorbers power is used it will switch to the second one and when 80% of that power is used it will switch of the sword completly and will only turn on when the mithril is done 
        fully regaining all of its power.
           Mode 2 Semi Safe mode: When 99% of the first mithril absorbers power is used it will switch to the second one and when 99% of that power is used it will switch of the sword completly and will only turn on when the mithril is 
        done fully regaining all of its power.
          Mode 3 Nuclear : It forces the sword to turn on even if the mithril in the sword hasn't completly regained all of its power. (Be warned it could yeild distructive results)
          Mode 4 Overload : Used for distroying the sword and mithril within it it will overload the mithril with power it it goes nuclear.(Warning after activation you have 5 seconds to escape or you will DIE)
      - The sword's blade is made of pure energy
      - The sword can also change the effect gravity has on it
           Mode 1 No gravity can affect the sword
           Mode 2 Normal gravity will affect the sword
           Mode 3 Custom the player can set a custom amount that gravity can affect the sword.
      - The sword can operate for 10 hours while using 80% of both mithril alsorbers
      - The sword can be distroyed with another energy sword
